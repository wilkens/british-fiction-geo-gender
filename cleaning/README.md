# Cleaning &amp; normalizing data

Cleaning &amp; normalizing data is sometimes a necessary process done before truthful research observations can be made.

First of all, this author rarely actually uses the word "clean" to describe data because its opposite ("dirty") has unnecessary negative connotations. A better word might be "normalize" because the goal is to reduce ambiguity and increase accuracy. 

Unnormalized data falls into three or four categories:

  * null - data with no values
  * incorrect - data whose values are untruthful
  * inconsistent - data whose values are manifested in multiple ways

In the given data set, there are many examples of null data. For example, in the bibliographics (metadata) file, as many as 5800 records have no author value:

| asdfas | asdfasdf | asdfasdf | asdfasdf | asdfasdf |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|        |          |          |          |          |
|        |          |          |          |          |
|        |          |          |          |          |
